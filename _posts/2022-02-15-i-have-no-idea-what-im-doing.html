<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm writing this immediately after getting the site working. I have not touched any of Wordpress's settings, nor do I know what they do. I'm just exhausted after 2 days of fuckery.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm starting this blog because I want a place to vent about all the dumb shit I encounter, hopefully to preserve this information in a more concrete form than random tweet threads or discord messages spread out amongst rando servers. This is one of those 2am musings ideas.</p>

<p>Everything I do is a pain in the ass and sucks and I inevitably end up complaining about it and now I've procrastinated about 15 minutes since writing the last paragraph and I've forgotten everything I wanted to say. This is what this blog will be like. No direction, just brain dump and ramblings on whatever topic happens to be giving me grief.</p>

<p>There was plenty more I was gonna write but its been 3 days now and I've forgotten it all so I'm just gonna post this and deal with it later.</p>
